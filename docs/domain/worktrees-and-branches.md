## Overview

Hamix scopes workspace access through **registered git worktrees** (`git_worktrees` rows). Each worktree has exactly one immutable `branch_id` (chosen at register/create). Each task carries `worktree_id`; the agent worker resolves the worktree path and bound branch at dequeue, verifies HEAD matches the bound branch (no `git checkout` at pickup), and `@`-mention validation resolves paths against the chosen worktree.

When no git repository is registered:

- The agent worker supervisor stays **idle** (`idle_reason=no_repository_registered`).
- `GET /repo/*` returns **400** without `worktree_id` query param, or **404** for unknown worktree.
- Prompts with `@`-mentions require `worktree_id` on create/patch.

Operators manage repositories, worktrees, and branches in the SPA (not Settings):

- **`/worktrees`** — repository list; register a main checkout here.
- **`/worktrees/:repositoryId`** — worktrees for one repository: reconcile, register/create/unregister worktrees, delete repository.

Hamix expects operators to follow **repository → worktree (+ branch) → task**:

1. **Register repository** on `/worktrees` — path to the main git checkout only (no branch field).
2. Open the repository and **Register worktree** or **Create worktree** — pick or add a linked directory and bind a branch in the same step (existing live branch or create new). The branch is fixed for the life of the worktree row.
3. **`/worktrees?register=1`** — deep link that opens the register-repository modal on the list page.
4. **Task create gate** — **New task** / **Start fresh** require at least one registered repository.

**Unregister vs delete from disk:** **Unregister worktree** in the SPA (or `DELETE /git/worktrees/{id}`) drops only the Hamix inventory row. The linked checkout directory and `git worktree` entry stay on disk — the path reappears in live inventory (`registered: false`) so you can **Register worktree** again. **Delete worktree** in the SPA (or `DELETE /git/worktrees/{id}?remove_from_disk=true`) runs `git worktree remove`, deletes the Hamix row, and removes the checkout directory; use `&force=true` when the tree has uncommitted changes. The main worktree cannot be deleted from disk via the API. **Create worktree** runs `git worktree add`: the UI asks for a parent folder plus a new directory name (the path Git will create).

**Runtime:** tasks on the same worktree run sequentially (per-worktree gate). Tasks on different worktrees may run in parallel when `HAMIX_AGENT_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` > 1. The worker does not switch branches — the worktree must already be checked out on its bound branch.

## Reconcile and path repair

Hamix stores **absolute paths** for repositories and worktrees. Renaming or moving directories on disk does not update the DB automatically. Use **Reconcile** on the repository detail page to sync Hamix with `git worktree list` while **preserving worktree IDs** (tasks and projects keep their bindings).

**Operator playbook when folders move:**

1. Prefer `git worktree repair` (or `git worktree move`) so git metadata stays consistent.
2. Click **Reconcile** on the repository detail page (`/worktrees/:repositoryId`). When the stored main path is missing, Hamix returns `needs_bootstrap_path` and opens **Relocate repository** — pick the checkout on disk. Hamix verifies branch HEAD / common dir before updating paths.
3. For a single linked worktree with a known new path, use `POST /git/worktrees/{worktreeId}/relocate` (API) or register/reconcile from the UI.

**What reconcile does:**

- Updates main and linked worktree paths for **registered** rows when git reports the same branch at a new location (stable `worktree_id`).
- Removes vanished registered rows when safe (no running tasks).
- Refreshes branch `head_sha` from git.
- Does **not** insert worktrees the operator has not registered — use **Register worktree** and live inventory for that.
- Does **not** fix non-git paths (Cursor binary, worker scratch files, `HAMIX_PATH_MAP` display prefixes).

**Live inventory:** `GET …/worktrees/live` includes `registered: false` for linked checkouts Hamix has not fully registered (no branch-bound worktree row). Registering a repository does not register its main worktree — use **Register worktree** for that. The register-worktree modal uses this list for path selection.

See [ADR-0040](../adr/ADR-0040-git-reconcile-v2.md), [git-checkout-resolution.md](./git-checkout-resolution.md), and `HAMIX_GIT_RECONCILE_ON_STARTUP` in [configuration.md](../configuration.md) for optional startup sync.

> **Important** — Workspace trees are **read-only over HTTP**. Mutations happen when the execute agent (or the operator outside Hamix) changes files on disk.

## Key concepts

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Git repository** | A registered main checkout (`git_repositories.path`) |
| **Worktree** | A linked working directory (`git_worktrees`) with fixed `branch_id` — main or added worktree |
| **Branch** | A repo-level ref (`git_branches`); bound to at most one worktree |
| **`WorkingDir`** | `runner.Request.WorkingDir` — task worktree path at dequeue |
| **`@`-mention** | Token in `initial_prompt`: `@path` or `@path(start-end)` |

## Worker and supervisor

- Idle reasons: `no_repository_registered`, `all_worktrees_invalid`, `paused_by_operator` (not a global settings path).
- Pre-run: per-worktree gate (`WorktreeGate`); optional HEAD verify — no checkout at pickup.
- Pool: N queue consumers share one `MemoryQueue` (`HAMIX_AGENT_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`, default 4). Busy worktrees defer pickup via `TryLock` (~5s).
- Delete guard: **409** `has_running_task` when a **running** task targets the worktree or branch.
- Unregister guard: same **409** when unregistering a worktree with a **running** task.

## HTTP `/repo/*`

All routes require `?worktree_id=`. `RepoProvider.OpenWorktreeRoot` opens the worktree path from the DB.

## Task completion hook

When the harness marks a task `done`, it appends an `on_task_done` audit event with `worktree_id` and `commits[]` (cycle commit index). Foundation for future PR automation — no UI in v0.1.
