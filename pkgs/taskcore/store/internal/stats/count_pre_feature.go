// count_pre_feature.go owns the one-shot startup counter the agent
// worker supervisor logs on boot so operators can see how many cycles
// pre-date the per-task runner/model attribution V2 keys
// (cursor_model_effective). Call once at startup, log the result, and
// move on — there is no live re-count.
//
// Why a Go-side scan rather than `meta_json::jsonb -> ?` SQL: the
// substrate runs on Postgres in production AND SQLite in tests, and
// the JSON1 / jsonb operators differ. Decoding in Go matches the
// scan_runners.go pattern and keeps the helper portable; the cost is
// O(N) over terminal cycle rows on a single startup query that is
// already bounded by `agentWorkerStartupSweepTimeout`.

// preFeatureMetaProjection is the minimal subset of cycle meta we
// need to decide whether a row pre-dates the V2 attribution keys.
// We treat a row as pre-feature when cursor_model_effective is
// missing OR explicitly empty (D2: empty string is the truthful
// "no model configured" value, but for the rollout count we want
// the operator-friendly "how many rows still need attention?"
// answer, which lumps both into the same bucket).

// counted separately so operators can tell "pre-feature row" from
// "feature ran but no model was configured" without re-querying.
//
// Cheap one-shot intended for supervisor startup; runs ONE SELECT
// over task_cycles and decodes meta in Go for portability with
// SQLite (used in tests). Safe to call on an empty database (returns
// 0/0/nil).
