/**
 * TaskListBulkActionBar — sticky bottom action bar that appears
 * whenever the operator has at least one selected row. Lives at
 * the bottom of the table so it never covers the rows being
 * acted upon.
 *
 * Three actions:
 *  - **Reschedule** (primary): opens TaskBulkRescheduleModal with
 *    the shared SchedulePicker. Disabled when `rescheduleDisabled`
 *    (e.g. a selected row is already done) or while `busy`.
 *  - **Clear schedule** (secondary): immediate PATCH N times with
 *    `pickup_not_before: null`. Disabled when none of the
 *    selected rows have a schedule (the operator's mental model
 *    is "remove the deferred-pickup time"; if nothing has one,
 *    there's nothing to clear). For N > 5 the parent renders a
 *    `confirm()` step before firing.
 *  - **Delete** (destructive): opens a confirmation modal; on confirm
 *    the parent DELETEs each selected task (server cascade per id).
 *  - **Cancel** (tertiary): clears the running selection without
 *    firing any mutations.
 *
 * Visibility (`selectedCount > 0`) and selection lifecycle
 * (clearing on filter/sort change or successful bulk action) are
 * the parent's concern; the bar is purely presentational.
